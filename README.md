### Configure variables.tfvars

1. Add your IP Address to the variable. To find your IP Address, run the following command:
	1. `curl http://checkip.amazonaws.com/`
2. Add that IP Address to variables.tfvars

### Terraform Create
1. Execute the following command from within the cloned project:
	1. `terraform apply --var-file variables.tfvars`
	2. Check whether the execution plan for the set of changes matches your expectations:
